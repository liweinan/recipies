The naked, wet man-beast rolls off, and strides around the bed to rescue a cat from a hairband. He stands for a moment, surveying the scene - cats on the bed, on the floor, me tucked under the covers. The one-eyed cat glaring from beneath my denims, and dancing feathers teasing the dreamcatcher, breathing colour against a stark wall.

I frown a little and he comes back, crawls next to me, mirrors my body with his. A cat curls up near four feet. Knees enfold knees, a cold, wet penis against my bum, chest chilly in winter sweat, on my back, and then strong arms around.

I rest my cheek on the hand that's there, and close my eyes. Furious scrabbling under the bed. "It's got your sock again," he murmurs as he falls asleep.

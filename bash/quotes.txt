We adore chaos because we love to produce order.
If this be not love, it is madness, and then it is pardonable.
To paint is a possessing rather than a picturing.
The sun does not shine for a few trees and flowers, but for the wide world's joy.
Freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be.
The man who interprets Nature is always held in great honor.

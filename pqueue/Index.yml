summary:
  Queue of Prioritized Elements

description:
  A priority queue is like a standard queue, except that each inserted elements
  is given a certain priority, based on the result of the comparison block given
  at instantiation time. Retrieving an element from the queue will always return
  the one with the highest priority.
